// change 1 - While going through code , it was clearly visible   that complete complex number is not initialized , imaginary part is missing.
// change 2 - In addition login , division of imaginary part with zero was a wrong logic.
// change 3 - Did not changed current value of any number (num1,num2,num3,num4) instead returned a new variable in order to maintain future scope of existing variables.
          
// Observation from output-
// 1. When imaginary part was not initialized in Constructor function, considering Java language nature, variables are initialized as 0, so imaginary part was valued 0 and irrespective of assigned value, ans for imaginary part was always 0i.

// 2. Division of 0 with imaginary part resulted in returning Infinity as answer Which also goes against the logic of addition of complex numbers.
